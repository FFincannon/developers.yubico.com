== FIDO2 Host Libraries
These libraries deal with communication on the (end-user) host side of things,
such as handing data from a WebAuthn enabled server and passing it to a FIDO Authentication device
connected over USB. If a WebAuthn enabled web browser is going to be used by the end
user, then these libraries should not be needed.
