|Term                       |Definition

|ACR                        |The OIDC EAP acr (Authentication Context Class Reference) claim and associated acr_values enable the relying party to request phishing-resistant and phishing-resistant hardware-protected authentication.
|Attestation Certificate    |Defined by FIDO, this is a public key certificate related to an Attestation Key used to validate a FIDO Authenticator
|CTAP                       |Client to Authenticator Protocol; Application level protocol for communication between an external authenticator (i.e. mobile phones, connected devices) and another client (re:browser) or platform (re: operating system). Frees user from having to register a key with every device. Developed by the FIDO Alliance.
|FIDO2                      |The FIDO2 standard is the new standard enabling the replacement of weak password-based authentication with strong hardware-based authentication using public key (asymmetric) cryptography.
|FIDO Alliance              |The FIDO Alliance is a standards body for enabling strong and fast authentication. The history of the FIDO Alliance can be found: https://fidoalliance.org/about/history/ where as the description of what FIDO does can be found: https://fidoalliance.org/about/what-is-fido/ 
|IDP                        |Identity Provider; the issuer of the identity held by the end-user
|OIDC                       |OpenID Connect; A standards-based authentication protocol that uses REST/JSON message flows, and is a derivative of the IETFâ€™s OAuth 2.0 family of specifications.
|OIDC EAP                   |Enhanced Authentication Profile; A security and privacy profile of the OIDC specifications that enables users to authenticate to OpenID Providers using strong authentication specifications.
|Token Binding              |IETF standard protocol; Token Binding prevents Bearer Token attacks by cryptographically binding application security tokens to the underlying TLS layer. RFC 5246 
|U2F                        |Universal Second Factor authentication delivered by Google Platform native support
|UAF                        |Mobile First Biometric authentication with 3rd party client software(client + ASM) needed on each mobile device 
|WebAuthn                   |A JavaScript API that enables FIDO Authentication in the browser. Originally developed by FIDO Alliance, accepted and standardized (pending) by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
